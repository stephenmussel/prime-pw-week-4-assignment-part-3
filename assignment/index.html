      <li><b>Line 29, 48: </b> Is this what you meant by removing the array argument? </li>
      <li><b>Line 35-39, 48: </b> If I did decided to pass through an array argument, would it be written like line 35-39 and tested like line: 80?</li>
      <li><b>General comment: </b> I think leaving the array argument was a relic from not entirely understanding the logic of a function enough.
        I had a loose understanding of the logic and the terminology used to talk about what was happening. Covering functions in class was very helpful.
        I wasn't expecting to have met most of the expectations for part 3. I was more confident with part 1 and 2 of the assignment but turned out I need more reinforement there.
        Fortunately, my logic error was consistent and was related to passing arguments in a function which now I have a better understanding.
